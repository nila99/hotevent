# hotevent
This web application, HotEvent, is basically a way to view events in your area, see where they are on a map, and filter by date if you prefer. It is written this in Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

An important thing to note is the way that different browsers respond to our web application. From experience, in Safari the program is fine, but in Google Chrome one must manually type “https://” before the url in the browser in order for the location services to work properly. It is unclear if this is true for other browsers, but in general, if https:// doesn’t immediately appear in the URL, it’s necessary for users to manually enter this in.
